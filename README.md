## about this repo
This is my first React Native project, and it is called `Tea Notes`. 

As a tea enthusiast, I always want to have a mobile app that can keep track of brewing tips of my favorite teas. 

Although there were quite a lot note-taking apps, they were not specially designed for teas. There was no easy way to use Celsius & Fahrenheit conversion functions, not mentioning tea-brewing timers, and alerts.

I decided to build a tea-note taking app by myself, as well as learning something new of React Native. From September 2016, to December 2016, I spent 3 months designing, building, and testing my idea.

And here is the outcome!


## how-to
1. clone this repo to your machine

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/chenzhe142/tea-notes.git
```

2. install React Native command line tool. you can follow the instruction on [React Native official tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)

3. open iOS version app on your machine (Mac only)
```
react-native run-ios
```

If `npm error` pops up, try running `npm install` to install missing dependencies.

feel free to shoot me an email if you have any questions. ;)
